//Description: The async_hooks module provides a way to track the lifetime of asynchronous resources in Node.js applications.
//Usage: The async_hooks module allows you to monitor and trace asynchronous operations, such as callbacks and timers.
//Example:

const async_hooks = require('async_hooks');

const hook = async_hooks.createHook({
  init(asyncId, type, triggerAsyncId) {
    console.log(`Async operation initiated: ${type}`);
  },
  destroy(asyncId) {
    console.log(`Async operation completed: ${asyncId}`);
  }
});

hook.enable();
